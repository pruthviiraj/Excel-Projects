# Excel-Projects: Data Storytelling Through Spreadsheets

Welcome! This repository is a curated collection of my end-to-end data analysis projects built entirely within **Microsoft Excel**.

While many focus on complex coding, I believe Excel remains one of the most versatile tools for translating raw numbers into actionable business strategy. This repo serves as a portfolio of how I use Pivot Tables, Power Query, and advanced formulas to solve real-world problems.

## Featured Projects

| Project Name | Objective | Key Techniques |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **[Customer Churn Analysis](https://github.com/pruthviiraj/Excel-Projects/tree/main/Customer%20Churn%20Analysis)** | Identifying why customers leave and which segments are at the highest risk. | Power Query, Cohort Analysis, Churn Rate Modeling. |
| **[Sales & Financial Performance](https://github.com/pruthviiraj/Excel-Projects/tree/main/Sales%20%26%20Financial%20Performance%20Analysis)** | Tracking revenue growth, profit margins, and sales rep performance across regions. | Dynamic Dashboards, `XLOOKUP`/`INDEX-MATCH`, KPI tracking. |

## The Excel "Full-Stack" Approach

I treat Excel as a complete data ecosystem rather than just a grid of cells:

* **Data Transformation**: Using **Power Query (M)** to automate the "boring" parts of data cleaning and connection.
* **Complex Logic**: Utilizing nested functions and array formulas for deep-dive calculations.
* **Visualization**: Creating clean, non-cluttered dashboards that follow data viz best practices (prioritizing clarity over decoration).
* **Human-Centric Design**: Every workbook is designed with the end-user in mind—ensuring that stakeholders can find the data they need in under three clicks.
